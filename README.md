**Step 1: Install Dependencies**
Before you can run the code, make sure you have the necessary Go packages installed:

go get github.com/antonlindstrom/pgstore
go get golang.org/x/crypto/scrypt
go get gorm.io/gorm

**Step 2: Set Up PostgreSQL Database**
Create a PostgreSQL database with the name "postgres" and a schema named "training." Make sure you have PostgreSQL running locally on the default port (5432). You can adjust the database connection parameters in the code if needed.

**Step 3: Create Required HTML Templates**
Create the following HTML templates in a "layout" folder in the same directory as your Go code:

layout/login.html for the login page.
layout/register.html for the registration page.
layout/home.html for the home page.
These templates should match the placeholders in your code.

**Step 4: Run the Application**
You can run the Go application by executing the main Go file in your terminal:
go run main.go

**Step 5: Access the Application**
Open a web browser and access the following URLs:

http://localhost:5555/ - This should take you to the login page.
http://localhost:5555/register - This is the registration page.
http://localhost:5555/logout - This logs out the user and redirects to the login page.
You can then interact with the application by registering new users and logging in.
